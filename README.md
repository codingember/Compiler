Project 5: Computer Architecture from Building a Modern Computer From First Principles is an in-depth exploration into the foundational components that constitute a modern computing system. In this project, I built a computer by designing and integrating essential modules from the ground up. The project begins with the development of Instruction Memory, which stores the set of machine instructions that guide CPU operations. Next, I implemented a comprehensive Memory system that not only handles data storage but also interfaces with simulated peripheral devices such as the Screen and Keyboard to provide output and capture input.


The heart of the project is the CPU module, which processes instructions by executing the classic fetch-decode-execute cycle. The CPU interacts with both instruction and data memory, performing arithmetic and logic operations that enable the computer to run programs. Finally, the complete Computer system is assembled by integrating all modules, demonstrating the interplay between memory, processing, and I/O operations. This project reinforces my understanding of computer architecture principles, digital logic design, and systems integration while providing a hands-on approach to building a computer from first principles. It is a comprehensive demonstration of turning abstract concepts into a tangible, functional system.
